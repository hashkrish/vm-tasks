# RegEx Problem 1

There is a file named ` match.txt ` in the current working directory, that contains some text that is to be matched.

Write your command in a file named ` script.sh ` which achieves the same.

Note : Run ` synchro init ` to get the file ` match.txt ` to your solutions directory. Use ` head ` command to check of a portion of its contents.
