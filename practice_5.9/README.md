# Week 5 Problem 9

The employee ID of a certain company is in the following format: ` DDYYPXXX ` where

- ` DD ` stands for department; ex: FN for Finance, SD for Software Development
- ` YY ` stands for work experience, which is a two digit number.
- ` P ` stands for position, which is a letter; e.g. M for Manager, etc.
- ` XXX ` stands for ID number. Which is a three digit number.

Given three Employee IDs, extract just the Department and the ID Number of these employees. Redirect all the output to the file named ` output.txt `.

The names of the variables which stores the employee Ids are shell variables with names ` eid1 `, ` eid2 ` and ` eid3 `. Redirect your output in the same sequence as ` sort -n ` order of the shell variable names.

Write your code in file ` script.sh `.
