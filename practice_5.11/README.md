# Week 5 Problem 11

Write a script ` script.sh ` to redirect the stderr of a command which is specified via variable ` cmd ` to a text file ` error.txt ` and print the stdout only if there is no error. 

Hint: Store the stdout to some file then based on success or failure of the command print that file.
