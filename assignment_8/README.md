# Assignment 8

Git offers a feature called cherry pick which is used to pick a commit from different branch and apply into your branch.

Your tasks are

- Clone the git repository from `/opt/repository/fibonacci` to `~/se2001/assignment_8/fibonacci` using `git clone`
- Create a branch `<your_roll_number>` from `master`
- Replace the example fibonacci input by your roll number (final three digits without preceded zeroes) in the file README.md and do a commit with message `update example`
- Cherry pick the commit `693dca7f5dae2b72a960018ba3df5b8819963b37` from the branch `remove-todo` and apply it your branch
- Merge the branch `<your_roll_number>` to `master` locally.
