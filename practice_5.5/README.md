# Week 5 Problem 5

A shell variable named ` TOTALCOST ` contains a string which is in the format ` XYZ_ABC_PQR `, where ` XYZ `, ` ABC ` and ` PQR ` are three digit numbers. Underscore ` _ ` is used to separate the three digit numbers.

Write a bash script ` script.sh ` that replaces all the underscores (` _ `) with commas (` , `) in the variable ` TOTALCOST ` and displays the final string on the screen.

Example: ` TOTALCOST=198_890_128 `

**Output**

```
198,890,128
```
